# React Example

This directory is a brief example of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with ZEIT Now and zero configuration.



### How We Created This Example

To get started with React, along with [Serverless Functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with ZEIT Now, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new React project, along with [Serverless Functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with a single command from your terminal using [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download):

```shell
$ now
```
